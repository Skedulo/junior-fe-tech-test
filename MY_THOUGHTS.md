# My thoughts

- The test is well-designed for testing FE dev.
- The requirements also very clearly to understand

I used a lots unnecessary approach for this small project. So I
decide to give you guys some explanations
- When I simulate fetching data, the good approach I was thinking
is move it into one custom hook for better maintenance and more 
easy to read rather than we throw a bunch of stuffs in one place
- I also add some features that I thought it maybe friendlier for
UX include clicking outside to close the search results and no
results display to notify user we have not the name they are
looking for
- Maybe I missed something about the contracts, I saw you provided
me a constractId in data's file. But I can't find any data to map id
beside that file. Correct me if I was missing.

That's it, I got a wisdom tooth removing last Tuesday so this test
was completed longer than I estimated. Sorry about that.
